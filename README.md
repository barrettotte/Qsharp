# Qsharp-2020

My notes and solutions for [Microsoft Q# Coding Contest](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77614)

This contest was the perfect excuse to mess around with quantum computing for the first time.


## Learning Approach
* Refresh on some mathematics - matrix algebra, vector spaces, and tensors.
* Read [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965)
* Go through [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas)
* Review previous years contests
